## 1. Introduction

In this tutorial, I’ll teach you how to create a bot to answer Frequent Answered Questions (FAQ) on your Facebook page, so when users message you they can get an (almost) instant answer about the question s/he made. 

To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:
1. A Facebook account and a Facebook page;
2. An AWS account (Free tier is Ok), no previous AWS knowledge is necessary;
3. Basic knowledge of programming (I’m going to use Python, but probably any programming language knowledge is fine, so you can understanding what I’m doing);

To host your bot and database, you’ll use Serverless technologies. This technology reduces the time you need to set up and manager your infrastructure, and it escales automatically to match your demand. It is great for applications such as a Messenger bot.

For Natural Language Processing (NLP), you are going to use Wit.ai, which is a Facebook platform that does half of the work necessary for creating a bot.

You can see the whole code used in this tutorial under the "code" directory of this repository.

## 2. Architecture

For the sake of this tutorial, you are going to use the following architecture:

![Architecture](pictures/architecture.png)

Whenever your page gets a message, Facebook Messenger will query your wit.ai application that will process the message using NLP techniques and send the result of that back to Messenger. So Messenger will send a call to your API (powered by API Gateway) which will invoke a lambda function that will query a database looking for the correct answer for that question, so the lambda will send the answer back through Messenger API.

This architecture solution is good if you want to deploy your bot only to Facebook Messenger. If you want to deploy it to more platforms (such as Whatsapp, your own website or Telegram), you will have to query wit.ai on the Lambda (because not every platform will have the option to integrate with wit.ai, as Messenger does). In my experience, querying wit.ai on lambda increases the latency a little bit. Probably, after following the steps of this tutorial, you will be able to figure out how to change this application to be used with many other platforms.

## 3. Define your bot

Before setting up your wit ai account and your bot infrastructure, it is important to learn about some Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and define which are the questions that your bot will answer.

For instance, suppose you are the owner of a local shop that because of COVID-19 pandemic setup an online infrastructure (including a website and a facebook page) to sell their products to the world. Let’s say that the most answered questions to that page are the following ones:

1) Question: How can I order from you?
Answer: go to our website www.example.com and order there

2) Question: Do you ship to my [city]?
Answer: It will depend on what city the customer wrote.

question above represents one customer “intent”, or what the customer meant to ask with the phrase (or “utterance”) he or she just wrote. You can have multiple utterances for the same intent, for example the question “How can I order from you?” could be asked as well “Do you have a website where I can order from?”, or “Can I order online?”. You have to train your wit.ai app with some possible utterances that a customer can use to ask about that intent. You don’t have to add every possible way that the customer could ask, because wit.ai intelligence will infer  from the examples you gave.

The [city] tag represents an entity. The customer could ask if you ship for several cities (for instance, New York City and Boston) and you should answer based on the city asks. Also, the customer could name the same city in several ways, for instance “New York City” could be “NYC” or “New York”.

In the next tutorial section, you are going to learn how to add intents, utterances and entities to your wit.ai application, so you can made it to process the questions your customers made to you. The answer for those questions are going to be stored on your database that you are going to learn how to model on section #7.

## 4. Set up your wit.ai application 


Wit.ai is the core of the Natural Language Processing of your bot. To set up your wit.ai application, follow the steps bellow:

1. First, login or create a free account in wit.ai webpage using your facebook credentials. 

2. On the main dashboard you should click on the “new” button to create a new application. Choose the name of the app and the language, and if you would like to let it public or not. Do not import any backup file.

![wit-1](pictures/wit-1.png)

3. Then, after creating your application, you are going to create the intents. Let’s call the first intent defined on the last section as “how_to_order” and the second one “shipping_available”. On your wit.ai portal, select the application you just created, and go to the management menu and select intent, then press the button “+ Intent” and type the name we just defined. Do this for each intent you want to create.

![wit-2](pictures/wit-2.png)

4. Now is time to create the entity for city, go to the entities page  and hit the button “+ Entity”. You can use three strategies for looking up to entities, Free Text, Keywords or a combination of both cases. In this case you are going to use “Free Text & Keywords”, but if you want understand more why, read about it on [wit.ai page](https://wit.ai/docs/recipes#which-entity-should-you-use)

![wit-3](pictures/wit-3.png)

5. Then you are going to add keywords and synonyms to these entities. Under the Entities page, select the entity you just created and click on “Add a new keyword”, for New York the keyword I’m going to add is “NYC”. Hit the button save.

![wit-4](pictures/wit-4.png)

6. Now you should add synonyms on the same page you created the keyword. Add as many synonyms you want. 

![wit-5](pictures/wit-5.png)


Do this process over and over again to create as many keywords you wish.

Last, but not least, it’s time to train your application. I’ll show you how to do it for each intent on the step 7 and 8 bellow.

7. Click on the menu item “Understanding”. In the main box there, type a utterance (phrase) that could be translated to the “how_to_order” intent you just created and choose this intent from the intent list. Click on the button “Train and Validate”. Do it for as many possibilities you may think of asking this kind of question,  Wit.ai intelligence will infer more precisely if it has more examples.

8. Now for the second type of question (that has an entity to it), type the question as you did before (for instance, “Do you ship to NYC?”) and choose the right intent. Probably Wit.ai interface will recognize the entity in the phrase but if it don’t, just select the word that is a entity (in this case NYC) and choose which entity it is (in this case, City). Hit the button “train and validate”.

![wit-6](pictures/wit-6.png)

After following those steps for as many utterances and entities you want to add, your Wit app is ready to integrate with Messenger. But before doing that, follow the 10th step:

10. visit the “Setting” page under management and you will have to copy the “Server Access Token” to use later when you set up your messenger app:

![wit-7](pictures/wit-7.png)

## 5. Set up your webhook with API Gateway and Lambda

Before setting up your messenger app, you will need to setup a Webhook that your messenger app will call every time it receives a message. Beforehand, Facebook does a verification that your webhook is yours. Basically, it does a GET request with the following parameters: 

* **hub.mode**: Set to subscribe
* **hub.verify_token**: You’ll provide a token when you set up your messenger page.
* **hub.challenge**: Generated by the Messenger Platform. Contains the expected response. You should return it.

As I said before, in this tutorial you are going to use AWS Serverless technologies. To do that, follow the steps bellow:

1.  open your AWS account, and search for Lambda. Under the Lambda page, select the “Functions” item on the menu and hit the button “Create a Function”. Select the option “Author from Scratch”, give it a name such as “MessengerTutorial”, select “Python3.8” as the runtime and hit the button “Create function”.

![api-1](pictures/api-1.png)

2. Now, under the function list, select the function you just created and there you will be able to edit the code deployed to your function. You should copy and paste the following code snippet there and click the button “deploy”, this code does the verification I just talked about.

> ***Note**: the token is hardcoded just because it is a 1 time deployment, ideally it should be an environment variable*

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    my_token = 'xxx'
    if (event['queryStringParameters']['hub.verify_token'] == my_token):
            return event['queryStringParameters']['hub.challenge']

```

3. Go back to the main page of your AWS console and search for “API Gateway”, and click on “Create API”, and select “HTTP API”.  Integrate it with the lambda you just created and give it a name and click on “Review and Create”. It will generate a Invoke URL for your API, which you should copy because it is the webhook you are going to user later. By default, AWS will create a endpoint that receives any kind of requets under `https://<invoke-url>/<API-NAME>`, for instance `https://2tvmim5n4.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MessengerTutorial`

![api-2](pictures/api-2.png)

Now you are good to go!

> ***Pro-tip**: if you are going to create this for a prod environment (not just a tutorial), you should use some Infrastructure as Code tool, such as CloudFormation or AWS CDK*

# 6. Set up your Messenger application

1. Login to your facebook account and visit the [Facebook for developers app page](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/). Now hit the button “create app”, select you are going to create an app to “Manage Business Integrations”. Fill the form with the app name and details, and hit the button “Create App ID”.

![msg-1](pictures/msg-1.png)

2. In the app settings page, click on Messenger and under “Access token”, add the Facebook page you created previously for this tutorial. Then after adding that page, generate a token and save it in a secure place (Attention, this token is not the same you are going to use to verify the webhook).

![msg-2](pictures/msg-2.png)

3. Under the page section “Webhooks”, click in “Add callback URL” and use the Invoke URL you saved in the step 5.3 of the tutorial as a callback url and set a token (the one which should be already in your code). Click on “Verify and Save”. It should verify your URL and save the callback URL. 

![msg-3](pictures/msg-3.png)

4. After the callback URL is saved, you should click on “Add Subscriptions” button and select “messages”, that means that every time your page get a message, Facebook will call your URL.


5. Now, under “Built in NLP” page section, choose the page you just created to add a Natural Language Processing model the select that built in NLP is on, then choose “Customer model” under the list of possible models. Then add the “Server Access Token” you saved on 4.10 section of this tutorial.

## 7. Set up your database

With what you’ve done so far, Facebook will query your wit.ai app and send a request to your lambda everytime it gets a new message. But now you should store the answer for that messages in your database.

You may be asking yourself why use a database, and not in an in memory data structure such as a dictionary, the answer is very simple, if you do like that, you will have to redeploy your app every time you want to add a new question, it it may cause down times and you will have more chance to add bugs into production.

You are going to use for this tutorial the database DynamoDb. DynamoDb is a fully managed NoSQL database. Some of the advantages of NoSQL when compared to SQL databases is that different entries to the database can have different structures because it’s based in a JSON structure, and it is optimized for search operations when compared to SQL databases. If you have performance issues with your DynamoDb you can additionally configure DAX (DynamoDb Accelerator) that creates a cache of your database to quicker access. For this tutorial, you are not going to use something as cache but you could in a real life application.

The key of your database will be the intent of your client, and it may have direct answers for those questions or answers depending on the intent. So the structure of you database would be something like:

```json
{
  "Answer": "Go to example.com and order online there",
  "Intent": "how_to_order"
}

{
  "city": {
    "NYC": "Yes, it'll be shipped in 3 days",
    "Other": "Not yet, sorry",
    "SFO": "Yes, it'll be shipped in 2 days"
  },
  "Intent": "shipping_available"
}
```

To do that follow the steps:

1. Go to your AWS Console and search for DynamoDb, click on “Create Table”, put something as “IntentTable” as table name, and “Intent” Primary Key, click on "create" button and wait to the table to be created:

![db-1](pictures/db-1.png)

2. Then, when you table is ready go to “Items”, and click on “Create item”;

3. When that opens, change the visualization mode from “tree” to “text”, and copy the JSON structure we defined above. 1 item per intent.

![db-2](pictures/db-2.png)

4. Before going to the next step, you will add the permission for the lambda you created in section 5 to access this database. Go back to the main page of your console, and search for IAM. In the IAM page, go to the “roles” subpage. AWS by default creates a role for every lambda function, search for the role created to your lambda (For instance, mines is `MessengerTutorial-role-rfeeh3nt`), then click on it;

5. In the page of your role, click on “Attach Policies” and look for the policy `AmazonDynamoDBReadOnlyAccess` and then click on `Attach policy`.

![db-3](pictures/db-3.png)

This will allow your lambda read any table on your DynamoDb, if you want a more granular policy (such as specifying the table) you should use tools such as CloudFormation or AWS CDK.

# 8. Implement your Lambda function

Now, it’s time to make your lambda function to get the right answer from the database and send it to the client. You should use multiple modules and classes in a real life application, but for simplicity this tutorial will show everything in a single module.

So you are going to implement four methods inside the lambda you created on Section 5 of this tutorial. They are the following ones:

* **lambda_handler**: The default method that is invoked when your lambda is called, somehow our main method;
* **decide_answer**:  It will query the database for the best answer according to the message received, it returns a String;
* **send_message**: it will send the message to your facebook account, it returns nothing;

Beforehand, you should know that the important parts of the message you lambda are going to get is the following one, in a real life application you should use “x-hub-signature” to verify if the message is really from Facebook (but for simplicity, this tutorial doesn’t do that), and the body will be used to get the entities and the intents from it:

```json
{
...
   "headers":{
...
      "x-hub-signature":"sha1=0f2aee9f347e8d80e212cebc1c91a1b4d5eeea6"
   },
...   "body":'{"object":"page","entry":[{"id":"100924728483431","time":1603640677983,"messaging":[{"sender":{"id":"32303620374447"},"recipient":{"id":"100924728483431"},"timestamp":1603640677875,"message":{"mid":"m_Lc2G7LdrUXrGv1t_cQA4fYK6oR002DuKOG6_oGmKyz6enpBrJOw3KP55OwCk8pp31xi0vVFEFgPk37c8S28xDw","text":"Do you ship to NYC?","nlp":{"entities":{"intent":[{"confidence":0.93422612890856,"value":"shipping_available"}],"city":[{"confidence":1,"value":"NYC","type":"value"}]},"detected_locales":[{"locale":"en_XX","confidence":0.9954}]}}}]}]}',
   "isBase64Encoded":False
}
```

So, let’s get started:

1. First, you need to get the token you saved in section 4.2, with that in hands go to your lambda function console and under “Environment variables” click on “Manage environment variables”. Then click on “Add environment variable”, as key choose something like “FB_TOKEN” and in value put the token Facebook generated for you, then click on save:

![lambda-1](pictures/lambda-1.png)

2. Now you are going to add the function that queries the database, you can see all the constant values used here in the code folder:

```python
def decide_answer(body):
    nlp_entities = body['entry'][0]['messaging'][0]['message']['nlp']['entities']
    
    if ('intent' in nlp_entities) and (nlp_entities['intent'][0]['confidence'] > MIN_CONFIDENCE):
        dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', region_name = REGION)
        table = dynamodb.Table(TABLE)
        try:
            # Querying the database
            table_item = table.get_item(Key={'Intent': nlp_entities['intent'][0]['value']})['Item']

            # Looking for a direct answer
            if('answer' in table_item):
                return table_item['answer']
            else:
                # Checking if the message has a valid entity
                entity = list(table_item.keys() & nlp_entities.keys())
                if len(entity) == 1:
                    entity_value = nlp_entities[entity[0]][0]['value']
                    if(entity_value in table_item[entity[0]]) and (nlp_entities[entity[0]][0]['confidence'] > MIN_CONFIDENCE):
                        return table_item[entity[0]][entity_value]
                    else:
                        return table_item[entity[0]][OTHER]
        except:
            return ERROR_ANSWER
           
    return ERROR_ANSWER

```

3. Now you should implement the function that sends the message to facebook:

```python
def send_response(message, body):
    token = os.environ['FB_TOKEN']
    url = 'https://graph.facebook.com/v2.6/me/messages?access_token=' + token
    payload = {
            'recipient': body['entry'][0]['messaging'][0]['sender'],
            'message': {
                "text": message
        }
    }
    requests = urllib3.PoolManager()
        headers = {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
        response = requests.request(
            'POST',
            url,
            body=json.dumps(payload),
            headers=headers
    )

```

5. Last, but not least, put everything together on lambda_handler:

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    body = json.loads(event['body'])
    message = decide_answer(body)
    send_response(message, body)

```

Now you can click on deploy button on your lambda console, wait a few seconds, and test on your Facebook page to see if it works:

![msg-5](pictures/msg-5.png)

## 9. Conclusions

You have now a functional application on your messenger. Before putting it into production, so other users can test and use it, there is a process on messenger platform to validate your bot.
